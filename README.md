# Workshop 2

This repository is a working space for a tutorial

## Workshop outline

### Create an issue

Create an issue in the SFU DHIL repository. Make it descriptive and unique enough to distinguish from your peers.

Optionally consult [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting help.

Make a note of the issue number. You will refer back to the issue by number later.

### Fork the repository

Create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account. You'll make changes to this fork and then request that they be incorporated back into the SFU DHIL repository.

### Clone the repository

Use GitHub Desktop to clone or download your forked repository to your computer. This will create a "local" copy of the code. You'll be working with this local copy, and once your changes are ready you'll move them up to your fork in GitHub.

### Make the changes to your repository.

Create a new text, HTML, or XML file in your local repository and add some content to it. You can use any text editor for this. I like to use Atom, but oXygenXML is also very good.

### Use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes.

A commit should include a short title and a longer description. For a quick fix or a very small change only the title is necessary.

If you include the phrase 'fixes sfu-dhil/workshop2#12' in your commit message, issue #12 will be automatically closed later. If you don't do that you will need to close the issue manually.

### Push your changes to GitHub.



### Create a Pull Request.

You can use GitHub Desktop or the GitHub website to do this. Tag or assign someone to the request if you'd like.

1. Update your fork of the repository.
