# Workshop 2

This repository is a working space for a tutorial

## Workshop outline

### Create an issue

Create an issue in the SFU DHIL repository. Make it descriptive and unique enough to distinguish from your peers.

Optionally consult [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting help.

Make a note of the issue number. You will refer back to the issue by number later.

### Fork the repository

Create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account. You'll make changes to this fork and then request that they be incorporated back into the SFU DHIL repository.

### Clone the repository

Use GitHub Desktop to clone or download your forked repository to your computer. This will create a "local" copy of the code. You'll be working with this local copy, and once your changes are ready you'll move them up to your fork in GitHub.

### Make the changes to your repository.

Create a new text, HTML, or XML file in your local repository and add some content to it. You can use any text editor for this. I like to use Atom, but oXygenXML is also very good.

### Use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes.

A commit should include a short title and a longer description. For a quick fix or a very small change only the title is necessary.

If you include the phrase 'fixes sfu-dhil/workshop2#12' in your commit message, issue #12 will be automatically closed later. If you don't do that you will need to close the issue manually.

### Push your changes to GitHub.

This will update your GitHub fork with the changes you have made. In a later step, you will collect the changes that other people have also made to the SFU DHIL repository.

Before you push your commit to GitHub check and double check that you are pushing to the origin remote, not the upstream remote.

### Create a Pull Request.

You can use GitHub Desktop or the GitHub website to do this.

a. For GitHub Desktop, use the Create Pull Request option in the Branch menu. This option will open the same browser page as in the next step.

b. To use the GitHub website to create the pull request, use the Pull Request link in your repository page.

Both options above will give you the opportunity to review the pull request. Once you are ready to continue, use the Create Pull Request button. GitHub will try to guess the title and description of your pull request based on the commits you created previous. You can edit the title and description.

### Update your fork of the repository.

Back in GitHub Desktop click the Fetch Origin button. This will update your local copy with any changes in your repository and in the SFU DHIL repository.

It's a very good idea to update your copy before you start working on something. If you haven't incorporated the most recent changes to the SFU DHIL repository you may run into conflicts when creating pull requests.
