# Workshop Notes

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will walk through a basic workflow together.

### Git

Git is a version control system. It tracks the changes to (versions of) a set of files over time. You can use Git to see who made what change at any point in time, to track the changes you have made and request that the changes are incorprated back.

A git _repository_ is a collection of files. Each team member creates a _fork_ of the repository to work with, and makes one or more _clones_ of their own fork on their computer. Each person edits, creates, or deletes files in their clone and _commits_ them. A commit is a bit like a save-point, marking the state of the files at a point in time. The team members _push_ the commits up to their fork of the repository and when they're ready they create a _pull request_ to have their changes incorporated into the repository.

The original repository (the SFU DHIL repository) is called the _upstream_ repository. A team member's fork is called the _origin_.

> It's OK if the terms upstream and origin don't make sense. They have a lot of historical baggage and are almost impossible to change now.

### GitHub

GitHub is a great example of an overloaded term:

* A fancy website

* A desktop tool to use use the fancy website

* Two different commandline tools

The website displays information about a repository including the complete history, tracks issues and pull requests, and stores copies of the repositories. The website also includes some basic text editing facilities, but they're very limited and won't be covered here.

The desktop tool can be used to clone repositories, create commits and issues, and push the commits up to the website.
